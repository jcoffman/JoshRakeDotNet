h1. Josh Rake .Net 

This is the basic, common set of rake tasks and RUby code which I'm using to build and deploy .Net applications using Jenkins-CI. 
The apps are mostly asp.net or asp.net mvc3 site, so the code is generally suited for those along with my standard approach to development. 
Meaning it targets FluentMigrator for schema migrations, nunit for tests because JenkinsCI supported reading the nunit results format, and making backups along with deployment.
